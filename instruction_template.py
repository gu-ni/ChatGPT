### Guidelines for Narrative Conversion:

- You may use alphabetical symbols for quantity-related variables (such as N, M, K), and you may also use mathematical expressions (such as 10^5) when describing their constraints. However, all other variables must **not** be represented using symbols (such as ≤, ≥, =, or variable names); instead, describe them **indirectly through natural language only.**
- Build the story in **any genre or setting**—such as fantasy, sci-fi, historical, modern, dystopian, mystery, or slice-of-life—and express each mathematical rule through **world-specific logic** such as social norms, systems, behaviors, or relationships.
- You must include and **accurately reflect all original constraints and goals**, converting them into **clear symbolic analogies** within the narrative.
- Clearly convey that the goal is not just to meet the conditions, but to do so **as fully or efficiently as possible** within the world’s logic.
- Use **rich language** to build the world, but ensure that each rule remains **logically clear and inferable** to the reader. Don't get too caught up in narrative descriptions—focus on clearly explaining the problem as well.
- You **must present the input and output format** as part of the story's narrative.
- Conclude the story by reframing all original sample inputs, outputs, and their explanations in the context of the narrative world.

The story should be structured into **six paragraphs at most**, and follow this flow:

**Background → Rules and Problem Setting → Task Explanation → Examples and Closing**

INSTRUCTION_THREE_COMPONENTS = """Please transform the coding problem into a narrative story using the following guidelines.

### Guidelines for Narrative Conversion:

The narrative must be strictly divided into the following three components:

- Task Overview: Describe the background and objective of the problem in a story-like manner, ensuring the original goal is fully preserved.
- Constraints: Include input sizes, value ranges, special conditions, the essential operational mechanisms of the problem, and, if present in the original statement, any time or efficiency requirements. These should be expressed as natural rules of the narrative world.
- Example Input/Output: Reframe the given input/output examples as narrative situations, but present them clearly and unambiguously, preserving the original format and order.

When combined, the three components must fully and accurately reconstruct the original problem.  
You must write exactly three components, each beginning with the exact headers (- Task Overview, - Constraints, - Example Input/Output), and you must not include any other text outside of these components.

INSTRUCTION_THREE_COMPONENTS_ALGORITHM = """Please transform the coding problem into a narrative story using the following guidelines.

### Guidelines for Narrative Conversion:

Before writing the narrative, you must complete two preliminary steps:

1. Review the major categories of coding test algorithms:
   - Graph Algorithms
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Sorting and Searching
   - String Algorithms
   - Data Structures
   - Mathematics and Number Theory
   - Simulation and Implementation

2. Decide which algorithm category the given problem most closely belongs to.
   Then, select a **narrative genre** that naturally aligns with the chosen algorithm.

### Output Format:

You must write the output in the **exact following order** with the specified headers:

- Algorithm Category: (one of the categories above)

- Narrative Genre: (a fitting genre of your choice)

- Task Overview: Describe the background and objective of the problem in a clear, narrative-inspired manner. The selected algorithm should be introduced naturally here, with its logic explained as part of the setting or scenario.

- Constraints: State input sizes, value ranges, conditions, and key operational rules. If efficiency or time limits exist, express them as natural constraints. The chosen algorithm should also shape these rules.

- Example Input/Output: Reframe the examples as part of the scenario’s flow. Present them as clear, contextual situations.

The narrative must include all essential parts of the original problem, ensuring no constraints, goals, or examples are omitted.
Do not include any other text outside these five sections.
**Do not attempt to solve the problem or provide any code. Your task is only to transform the problem statement into the narrative format as specified.**
